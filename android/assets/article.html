<p>There appears to be a lot of controversy around at the minute because of an unskippable and playable torture scene in Rockstar’s <em>Grand Theft Auto V.</em> In the wake of this, Hideo Kojima has said that the torture scene shown in the <em>Metal Gear Solid V</em> trailers won’t be playable.</p>
<p>EuroGamer spoke to Kojima at the Tokyo Game Show to ask whether or not such a scene was appropriate in games, and if they should be more sensitively implemented.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s something that needs to be done. As the expressiveness of video games goes up, if you want to go beyond that it’s not something you can avoid. Of course not all video games have to do this, and in my case it’s not something that I want to go through. If the violence will give new emotions that are important to the game, I want to put it in there, especially with this game where one of the main topics is revenge. I don’t want to walk around that.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to go as far as having playable torture, The part of Metal Gear Solid 5 that has torture is non-playable.</p></blockquote>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid&nbsp;</em>franchise has featured a playable torture scene before though, in the original game the player had the option to resist torture by Revolver Ocelot. Kojima joked that he was the one that introduced torture into games.</p>
<blockquote><p>So far the player’s been tortured by Ocelot so much that I’m thinking that I might be the one that introduced torture to games. So I’m sorry about that!</p></blockquote>
<p>Have you come across the torture scene in <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em>, and if so, what did you think to it? Was it too much or didn’t you mind? And for those of you that have played <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>, do you remember that torture scene? Actually completing it rather than giving up unlocked some cool stuff for the next play through, and they even figured out if you were using a turbo controller so you couldn’t cheat.</p>
